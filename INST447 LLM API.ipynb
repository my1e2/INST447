    "### How LLM APIs Work (Conceptual Flow)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You prepare a prompt:**\n",
    "   - Instruction: \"Classify the sentiment of this review\"\n",
    "   - Data: \"The food was amazing!\"\n",
    "   - Format request: \"positive, negative, or neutral\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Send to API:**\n",
    "   - HTTP POST request with your prompt\n",
    "   - Include API key for authentication\n",
    "   - Specify model to use\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LLM processes:**\n",
    "   - Model analyzes your prompt\n",
    "   - Generates response based on training\n",
    "   - Returns text output\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **You receive and parse:**\n",
    "   - Extract generated text from JSON response\n",
    "   - Parse into desired format (may need cleaning)\n",
    "   - Handle errors if response is unexpected\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **You pay:**\n",
    "   - Cost based on tokens (chunks of text)\n",
    "   - Both input tokens (your prompt) and output tokens (response)\n",
    "   - Example: ~$0.0005 for 1000 tokens on GPT-3.5"

    "### Important Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokens:**\n",
    "- Not the same as words\n",
    "- Roughly: 1 token ≈ 4 characters ≈ 0.75 words\n",
    "- Example: \"Hello, world!\" ≈ 4 tokens\n",
    "- Both input and output count toward cost\n",
    "\n",
    "**Models:**\n",
    "- Different models = different capabilities, speed, and costs\n",

    "- For creative tasks, higher temperature (0.7-1.5)\n",

    "\n",
    "**LLM APIs use a \"chat\" format with different roles:**\n",

    "**1. System Message (optional but powerful):**\n",
    "   - Sets the behavior/personality of the assistant\n",
    "   - Example: \"You are a helpful data analyst who gives concise answers.\"\n",
    "   - Think of it as \"programming\" the AI's behavior\n",
    "   - Stays consistent across the conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. User Message:**\n",
    "   - Your actual request or question\n",
    "   - Example: \"Classify the sentiment of this review: ...\"\n",
    "   - This is what you're asking the AI to do\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Assistant Message:**\n",
    "   - The AI's responses\n",
    "   - When building chat history, previous responses go here"

    "**How chat history works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Each API call is independent! The model doesn't \"remember\" previous calls.\n",

    "    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's 2+2?\"},\n",

    "    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What about 2+3?\"}  # Now AI has context!\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:**\n",
    "- Each API call is stateless (no memory between calls)\n",
    "- To maintain context, include previous messages in the array\n",
    "- The model sees what you send, nothing more\n",
    "\n",
    "**For data processing (our focus today):**\n",
    "- We usually use simple system + user messages\n",

    "- **Use cheaper models when possible:** GPT-5-mini vs GPT-5\n",
    "- **Set spending limits** in API dashboard\n",
    "- **Cache results:** Don't reprocess the same data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling\n",
    "- **APIs fail** (network issues, service outages like AWS)\n",
    "- **Implement retries:** Try 2-3 times before giving up\n",
    "- **Save progress frequently:** Don't lose work on crash\n",
    "- **Log errors** for debugging\n",

    "### Rate Limiting\n",
    "- **APIs have limits** depending on tier\n",
    "- **Add delays:** `time.sleep(1)` between requests\n",
    "- **Or use batch APIs:** Submit many requests at once\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security\n",
    "- **Never commit API keys to git!**\n",
    "- **Use environment variables:** `os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')`\n",
    "- **Set spending limits** in dashboard\n",
    "- **Rotate keys** if exposed\n",

    "- **Be specific:** \"Classify as positive, negative, or neutral\" (not just \"sentiment?\")\n",
    "- **Specify format:** \"Return JSON with sentiment and confidence\"\n",
    "- **Test and iterate:** Try on examples, refine prompt"
