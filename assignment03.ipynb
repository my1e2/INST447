    "## Course: INST447 - Data Sources and Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this assignment, you will practice:\n",
    "- Parsing and navigating nested JSON structures\n",
    "- Flattening JSON data into pandas DataFrames using `json_normalize`\n",
    "- Making API calls and handling responses\n",
    "- Implementing responsible API usage practices (rate limiting)\n",
    "- Reproducing visualizations for exploratory data analysis\n",
    "- Using AI tools effectively for data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset: UMD Course Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of you may have already been using PlanetTerp to check course information, let's see how we can programmatically access data hosted on PlanetTerp. We'll work with its data sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **JSON file from GitHub**: All UMD courses from Fall 2019 (5.7 MB, 4,582 courses)\n",
    "   - Source: [umdio/umdio-data](https://github.com/umdio/umdio-data)\n",
    "   - Direct link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umdio/umdio-data/refs/heads/master/courses/data/201908.json\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **PlanetTerp API**: Grade data, professor ratings, and course information\n",
    "   - API Documentation: https://planetterp.com/api/\n",
    "   - Base URL: `https://planetterp.com/api/v1`\n",
    "   - Optional: Download [OpenAPI specification](https://planetterp.com/api/openapi.yaml) for AI coding assistants (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on AI Assistance\n",
    "You are **encouraged** to use AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.) to help you complete Questions 1-5. Learning to effectively use AI tools for coding is a valuable skill. In Question 6, you'll reflect on how you used these tools and what you learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip for AI coding tools:** If you're using Cursor or Claude Code, you can download the OpenAPI specification from PlanetTerp and include it in your project. These tools can read the specification to understand the API endpoints directly!\n",

    "## Question 2: Flattening Nested JSON with json_normalize (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation:** Most data analysis requires flat tables, but real-world data often comes in nested formats. The `json_normalize()` function is a powerful pandas tool for flattening nested JSON. `json_normalize` is like \"exploding\" nested lists into separate rows. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input JSON:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"INST447\", \"sections\": [{\"num\": \"0101\"}, {\"num\": \"0102\"}]},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"INST326\", \"sections\": [{\"num\": \"0101\"}]}\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**After flattening with `json_normalize`:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "   name      num\n",
    "0  INST447   0101\n",
    "1  INST447   0102\n",
    "2  INST326   0101\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how:\n",
    "- Each section becomes its own row\n",
    "- The parent information (course name) is repeated for each section\n",
    "- We go from 2 courses to 3 rows (one per section)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to extract all the sections of INST courses in Fall 2019, though section information is nested in courses in the json structure. You want to create a DataFrame where:\n",
    "- **Each row represents one section** (not one course)\n",
    "- The row should include information from the parent course (like `course_id`, `name`, `credits`, `dept_id`)\n",
    "- The row should also include information from the section itself (like `section_id`, `seats`, `instructors`, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Filter the `courses` list to only INST courses (`dept_id == 'INST'`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use `pd.json_normalize()` to flatten this nested structure\n",
    "   - **Hint:** Think about which part of the JSON is the \"nested list\" you want to explode\n",
    "   - **Hint:** Think about which fields from the parent course you want to keep in each row\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Display:\n",
    "   - The shape of the resulting DataFrame (rows, columns)\n",
    "   - The column names\n",
    "   - The first 10 rows\n",

    "## Question 4: Multiple API Calls - Comparing INST 4xx Grades (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation:** Which senior-level INST course has the best grades? Let's use the PlanetTerp API to find out!\n",
    "\n",
    "### IMPORTANT: API Etiquette and Rate Limiting\n",
    "\n",
    "When making multiple API calls, **ALWAYS** include a delay between requests. This is both respectful to the API server and helps you avoid hitting rate limits that many APIs impose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common delay strategies:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simple fixed delay (most common)\n",
    "time.sleep(1)  # Wait 1 second between requests\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exponential backoff (for more robust applications)\n",
    "time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Wait 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s... on retries\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, a simple 1-second delay between requests is sufficient. **You will lose points if you don't include delays!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare grade distributions for these INST 4xx courses in **Spring 2024 (semester code: 202401)**:\n",
    "- INST414 (Data Science Techniques)\n",
    "- INST447 (Data Sources and Manipulation)\n",
    "- INST462 (Introduction to Data Visualization)\n",
    "- INST466 (Technology, Culture, and Society)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each course:\n",
    "1. Call the `/grades` endpoint with appropriate parameters for the course and semester\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use `time.sleep(1)` between API calls!**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Aggregate grades across all sections (one course may have multiple sections)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate for each course:\n",
    "   - Total number of students\n",
    "   - Percentage of A-range grades (A+, A, A-)\n",
    "   - Percentage of B-range grades (B+, B, B-)\n",
    "   - Percentage of C-range or below (C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F)\n",
    "   - Withdrawal rate (W)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a summary comparing all 4 courses\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Interpret the results - what do you observe about grade distributions across these courses?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- Check the API documentation for the `/grades` endpoint parameters\n",
    "- The API returns a list of grade records (one per section)\n",
    "- You'll need to aggregate across multiple sections for each course"

This reality still holds true even when the number of students within the course is drastically larger in comparison to the others (INST462).

    "\n",
    "Create a similar grade distribution visualization for **INST447 using ALL available semester data**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get all INST447 grade data from the API (don't filter by semester)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Aggregate the data across all sections and semesters\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Analyze the PlanetTerp chart structure and reproduce it:\n",
    "   - Determine what the axes should represent\n",
    "   - Figure out how to structure the bars (they're \"stacked\" - how?)\n",
    "   - Implement an appropriate color scheme\n",
    "   - Add proper labels and title\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Save your figure as `'inst447_grades.png'`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- Look closely at how PlanetTerp groups grades (A+, A, A- are related to \"A\")\n",
    "- The bars are stacked - matplotlib's `bar()` function has a `bottom` parameter\n",
    "- You may want to calculate percentages rather than raw counts\n",
    "- For colors, you can use hex codes like `'#90EE90'` or color names like `'lightgreen'`\n",
    "- Try describing what you want to achieve to an AI: \"I want to create a stacked bar chart where each letter grade (A, B, C, D, F, W) is a bar, and within each bar I show the +, normal, and - versions stacked on top of each other\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge:** Can you make yours look as clean and professional as the example above?"

    "For this assignment, AI was used as a means for understanding how the approaches to certain problems might work rather than genuine replacement for the thinking process regarding whatever I was struggling with. This meant that the learning was still taking place even in times where I ran into problems with my code that I needed to debug. For instance, during question 2's JSON flattening, I wanted more of an in-depth explanation for the 'json_normalize' method, and therefore asked AI to provide examples of how to use the parameters within the method for my specific use case in the problem. In doing this, I was able to grasp the conceptual procedures behind a nested list and what exactly happens when the observations are placed with the parent fields that are preserved in the new data frame. In addition, for questions like number 4, AI was able to help me structure my response with proper API etiquette that could handle status code errors and sequential requeests with time.sleep delays between calls as necessary. The nested nature of the section and grade data that was within the API also would've been quite difficult to sort through without AI's help, as I needed to understand how to access a student's information on every necessary level. In incrementally testing the AI's output with different parameters and API endpoints, I was able to verify that what I was receiving was correct alongside manual calculation or documentation. I also learned a lot of valuable data vizualization tools for python in visiting the PlanetTerp site for information on how they establish the output for their own charts. When querying this information, I parsed out what was useful from the particularly complex solutions and cross-referenced it with what I believed to be simpler approaches to the issue. "
