This course will provide an overview of this exciting field and examine how social and behavioral theories can be applied to create effective health applications.It is difficult to create health technologies that can successfully be integrated into people\\'s daily life due to many obstacles in individuals\\' data collection, integration, self-reflection, and sharing practices. Understanding these challenges is an important part of designing Health Technologies.

        "Depending on the dataset, the features that are utilized as representations of items for vectors usually deals with numerical data. In the case of movie representation, the number of movies in a particular genre category, and the totals for actor counts in each of these movies (casting roles) would certainly be valuable to have as observations within this combination of vectors. \n",

        "\n",
        "The aspects associated with similarity proportions or values are directly determined by the features that are changed to represent the situation. For movies, the inclusion of actor counts and movie genres would mean similarity is based on the film's narrative and thematics which are associated with the specific actors that might engage with these genres more often. However, if I decided to include features that aggregated ratings and movie reviews, then the similarity betwen items would be defined by the commercial success of the movie since these metrics are directly associated with how well the film is received publicly. Like before, the choice of features that you choose to represent the situation helps to determine the characteristics that are associated with the grouping of said items. \n",
        "\n",
        "Why is normalization or scaling important in vector representations?\n",
        "\n",
        "Normalization and scaling allow the vast range of statistical presence and representation to be uncovered accurately for trend analysis and insights that actually showcase the bigger picture in the story of the data that one may be looking at. Many times big data is distorted by the velocity at which it comes in and dominates in one area during large scale features or distance calculations. By normalizing the data to a scale that encapsulates each feature equally for similarity measures (0-1 ranges, noise-reduction, etc.), comparisons for clustering, model classification, and visualization, things become much clearer and accurate for understanding. \n",
