The British were led by General John Burgoyne. On October 17 Burgoyne surrendered his army of nearly 6,000 British soldiers. The American victory helped convince France to come to the aid the Continental Army. It also helped them recognize the United States.
In early 1777, General William Howe asked London to approve his plan to attack Philadelphia. This would destroy the rebel American government. In Canada, General John Burgoyne submitted a plan to move down through New York and meet General Howe at Albany. This would divide the colonies. London approved both plans. Burgoyne began moving down the Hudson River valley from Canada. He split his force into two columns. One, under Colonel Barry St. Leger moved east from Lake Ontario down the Mohawk Valley.

Static friction is when the friction is strong enough to stop movement between two objects. Kinetic friction is when the frictional force is not strong enough to stop all motion.
Some facts about friction are:
Friction can be thought to be caused by bumps on two touching surfaces. These bumps are called asperities. As these two rough surfaces move against each other they get stuck and prevent motion until the asperities are broken or slid over. Even the smoothest materials have these asperities.
s the force that is pushing on an object increases, the static friction increases too. However, if the force gets bigger than the maximum static friction, it makes the object accelerate (begin to move).

Static friction is when the friction is strong enough to stop movement between two objects. Kinetic friction is when the frictional force is not strong enough to stop all motion.
Some facts about friction are:
Friction can be thought to be caused by bumps on two touching surfaces. These bumps are called asperities. As these two rough surfaces move against each other they get stuck and prevent motion until the asperities are broken or slid over. Even the smoothest materials have these asperities.
s the force that is pushing on an object increases, the static friction increases too. However, if the force gets bigger than the maximum static friction, it makes the object accelerate (begin to move). The thing will begin to accelerate as soon as the static friction is less than the force pushing on it. After that point kinetic friction will act on the object.",moderately complex,"ss_annotator_1: FK places this text in the 4-5 or 6-8 band.

This is because the toad lifestyle, with its dry, rough, skin, is an adaptation to living in drier habitats. The toad form has evolved a number of times independently, an example of convergent evolution.
Frogs can live on land and in fresh water. They cannot survive in salt water. Their development is by metamorphosis. They usually hatch as tadpoles from eggs, which are laid by a female frog. The eggs are called frogspawn. Tadpoles have tails and gills. When they grow up, they lose their tails and gills and grow four long legs.

For example, if Christy knows how to perform a ball trick she might explain it to the other group members. As a result, all group members feel that they can achieve much more than they could alone. In psychology, we have found that people who experience such advantages from their social groups are healthier and experience less stress.
However, it is not the support of just anyone that can have a positive effect on your health. The health benefits of social support depend on your social identity.

The first step is to obtain a digital 3D image of the object to be printed, using various types of 3D scanners. Then, this digital information must be converted into a form easily understood by the 3D printer, called an STL. This is done using computer software. At this stage, we can design the future object on the computer. The last step is to send this STL file to the printer so that the 3D model can be printed. Keep reading to find out about some ways that dentists have been using 3D printing to provide better oral care for their patients.

This region processes only the most basic information about the visual world, such as lines, edges, color, and direction of motion. The primary visual cortex then sends this basic information forward through the brain along the ventral visual pathway (ventral is from Latin venter, meaning ""belly""). The information processing performed by the ventral visual pathway supports our conscious awareness of what we are seeing, which allows us to talk about what we see.
The ventral visual pathway works to combine simple visual information, like lines, edges, and color, to create entire objects.

President Wilson was enraged. Wilson's Secretary of State, William Jennings Bryan, recommended a ban on American travel on any ships of nations at war. Wilson preferred a tougher line against the German Kaiser. He demanded an immediate end to submarine warfare, prompting Bryan to resign in protest.

Flamingos eat organisms such as plankton, shrimps, crabs and tiny water plants. All of these have special coloring agents which cause a flamingo to turn pink when it eats them.
If you take a flamingo away from its natural habitat and don't feed it these kinds of food, their color will turn whiter and whiter as days pass by. Flamingos are water birds – they live and feed near the sea coast and lakes as the food they eat is found in water. They are quite tall – some of them can grow up to a height of 1.5 meters. That is almost as tall as a human!
These birds have very long legs so they can walk far into the water. Although most photos will show you pictures of flamingos wading in the shallow water, these birds can also swim!

142,3254,3,8.73,"Probably the most widely accepted theory explaining the evolution of larval stages is the need for dispersal. Sessile organisms such as barnacles and tunicates, and sea-floor groups like mussels and crabs, need some way to move their young into new territory, since they cannot move long distances as adults. Many species have relatively long pelagic larval stages (how long a larva is in the water column). During this time, larvae feed and grow, and many species move through several stages of development. For example, most barnacles molt through six nauplius larva stages before molting to a cipris, when they look to settle. The larvae eat different food from the adults, and disperse.
The other consideration is the small size of the eggs. If animals lay many small eggs (and most do), then the young stages cannot live the life the adults lead. They must live a separate life until they have the size and capability to live as an adult. This is what the larvae do.",exceedingly complex,"ss_annotator_1: Demands for background knowledge and vocab are too high for 3rd or 4th.

Along the road from the foremost trenches came a dozen Belgian soldiers, just relieved after twenty-four hours of what it is difficult to describe otherwise than as hell.

His wife, however, insisted on going with him to the New World. Whether or not this was a proof of wifely devotion—and if it was, it is the only thing in history to his credit—or of an unwillingness to trust Pedrarias out of her sight, which is more likely, is not known. At any rate, she went along.
Pedrarias, up to the time of his departure from Spain, had enjoyed two nick-names, El Galan and El Justador. He had been a bold and dashing cavalier in his youth, a famous tilter in tournaments in his middle age, and a hard-fighting soldier all his life. His patron was Bishop Fonseca.

If a little acid is added to calcium hydroxide, it dissolves it, making the calcium react very fast. It burns when powdered to make a reddish flame. This makes calcium oxide. It also makes calcium nitride when heated. It can react with halogens to make calcium halides like calcium chloride with chlorine.

The first known use of the term in a political context was by François-René de Chateaubriand in 1818. This was during the period of Bourbon restoration that sought to roll back the policies of the French Revolution.
The term is associated with right-wing politics. It has been used to describe a wide range of views. There is no single set of policies that are regarded as conservative, because the meaning of conservatism depends on a given place and time.

However, the bacteria in its intestines continue to live and produce gases, gradually making the body swell. Like a balloon filled with air, the body floats and rises to the sea surface. But, as the bacteria continue to decompose the body, the carcass will eventually develop holes and let out the gases that kept it on the surface.

267,2024,4,8.37,"When an animal dies, its body changes in appearance. It will gradually disappear as it is eaten by other animals and bacteria. This process is called decomposition. When a sea turtle dies, the first thing that happens is that the body of the turtle, known as a carcass, sinks to the bottom of the sea floor. However, the bacteria in its intestines continue to live and produce gases, gradually making the body swell. Like a balloon filled with air, the body floats and rises to the sea surface. But, as the bacteria continue to decompose the body, the carcass will eventually develop holes and let out the gases that kept it on the surface. It sinks again and disappears to the bottom of the sea permanently.
The turtles found stranded on Virginia's beaches arrived floating. They had not yet released the gases they contained, otherwise they would have sunk and remained at the bottom of the sea without reaching the beach. Since we ultimately wanted to understand why these sea turtles died, we first needed to figure out where and when they died.",moderately complex,"ss_annotator_1: The text consists of mostly complex sentences.

299,2115,3,7.03,"Hormones are the chemical messengers of the endocrine system. Hormones are the signals which adjust the body's internal working, together with the nervous system. Every multicellular organism has hormones. The cells which react to a given hormone have special receptors for that hormone. When a hormone attaches to the receptor protein a mechanism for signalling is started. The cell or tissue that gets the message is called the 'target'. Hormones only act on cells which have the right receptors.
Many different kinds of cells can send a message. There are some kinds of cells whose main job is to make hormones. When many of these cells are together in one place, it is called a gland. Glands are groups of cells that make something and release it (put it outside the cell). Many glands make hormones. ""Endocrine"" means secreting directly into the blood.

Plasma is created by adding energy to a gas so that some of its electrons leave its atoms. This is called ionization. It results in negatively charged electrons, and positively charged ions. Unlike the other states of matter, the charged particles in a plasma will react strongly to electric and magnetic fields (i.e. electromagnetic fields). If a plasma loses heat, the ions will re-form into a gas, emitting the energy which had caused them to ionize.
Over 99% of the matter in the visible universe is believed to be plasma. When the atoms in a gas are broken up, the pieces are called electrons and ions.

The explosion blows of its stellar material away from the star, at velocities up to 30,000 km/s or 10% of the speed of light. This drives a shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium.

Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes have a steep profile and periodic eruptions. The lava that flows from stratovolcanoes cools and hardens before spreading far. It is sticky, that is, it has high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, with high-to-intermediate levels of silica, and less mafic magma. Big felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as 15 km (9.3 mi).
Two famous stratovolcanoes are Japan's Mount Fuji, and Vesuvius. Both have big bases and steep sides that get steeper and steeper as it goes near the top. Vesuvius is famous for its destruction of the towns Pompeii and Herculaneum in 79 AD.
A caldera is a basin-like feature formed by collapse of land after a volcanic eruption. This happens after a huge stratovolcano blows its top off.

405,2463,4,8.61,"A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a tall, conical volcano. It is built up of many layers of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash.
Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes have a steep profile and periodic eruptions. The lava that flows from stratovolcanoes cools and hardens before spreading far. It is sticky, that is, it has high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, with high-to-intermediate levels of silica, and less mafic magma. Big felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as 15 km (9.3 mi).
Two famous stratovolcanoes are Japan's Mount Fuji, and Vesuvius. Both have big bases and steep sides that get steeper and steeper as it goes near the top. Vesuvius is famous for its destruction of the towns Pompeii and Herculaneum in 79 AD.
A caldera is a basin-like feature formed by collapse of land after a volcanic eruption. This happens after a huge stratovolcano blows its top off. The base of the crater then sinks, leaving a caldera where the top of the volcano was before. Krakatoa, best known for its catastrophic eruption in 1883, is much smaller now.",very complex,"ss_annotator_1: The text is largely comprised of complex sentences.

Most paintings are in caves that are difficult to access. These caves usually also do not show signs that people lived there all year round.
Today, there are about 350 caves known which have paintings in them. Many are in France and Spain. The best known are probably the caves of Altamira (in Spain), Lascaux (in France), or Creswell Crags in England. Sometimes, paintings were also done on cliff faces. Fewer of those have survived though, because of erosion. One such example are the rock paintings of Astuvansalmi (in Finland).

Squares, circles and triangles are some of the simplest shapes in flat geometry. Cubes, cylinders, cones and spheres are simple shapes in solid geometry.
Geometry can be used to measure the area and perimeter of a flat shape. It can also be used to measure a solid shape's volume and surface area.
Geometry can be used to calculate the size and shape of many things. For example, geometry can help people find:
the surface area of a house, so they can buy the right amount of paint
the volume of a box, to see if it is big enough to hold a liter of food
the area of a farm, so it can be divided into equal parts
the distance around the edge of a pond, to know how much fencing to buy.",slightly complex,"ss_annotator_1: slightly complex as it includes mainly simple sentences. appropriate for grade 3 because of limited complex sentences however some of the punctuation and very long sentence at the end could be potentially challenging

In response to stress, the cell will use its DNA to make RNA, so that it can then make proteins that will fight off the stress. If an organism has been stressed before, it can respond to the stress faster and better. Think of it like visiting a city: the first time you visit, you will need a map to find your hotel.

In general, plants survive drought in three ways: avoiding, resisting or tolerating it. Plants that avoid drought have a short life (a few months). In the rainy season, after seed germination new plants grow. In a short time, these new plants flower and produce seeds. Then, the plants die before the dry season starts. Their seeds will stay alive in the soil, waiting for the next rainy season so they can germinate and continue the cycle. Many crops are examples of drought avoiders, such as corn, wheat, and rice.
Plants that resist drought, such as cacti and other succulents have several mechanisms to prevent dehydration. For example, they have structures inside their stems specialized for storing water.

When you travel to a glacier and look at it, you will see an enormous collection of ice, which lays in between mountains tops. At first sight, nothing seems to be moving, but this is not the case. Ice is actually a very thick liquid, and moves like honey, but very slowly. If you want to see a glacier move, you will need to wait a long time. But if you take a picture and come back some days or weeks later to take a second picture, the ice will have moved, and this can be measured if you compare both images. When we research glaciers, we use the same technique, but we use pictures from satellites. The satellites fly over every part of the Earth and can see any glacier.

before if you have ever seen a blacklight poster or paint illuminated with blacklight. Fluorescent colors seem to glow, because they absorb one color of light and then they emit a different color. This is because of the way the pigment (color) molecules release energy from the light they absorb. When a pigment molecule absorbs light energy, it usually slowly releases the energy as heat. Instead, a fluorescent molecule releases some of the energy from the light it absorbed as new light that has lower energy than the light that was absorbed. Normal pigments just cannot do this—they can only bounce back colors of light that exist already in their environment. That is why fluorescent colors look amazing and a bit unbelievable.

First, let me reassure you: FRDA is not an infectious disease, meaning that you cannot catch it from another person like you can catch the flu or measles. FRDA is a disease that I have inherited from my parents and that I could transmit to my children. What I mean is the following: as you may know, a baby inherits half of its genetic information (on whether it will have blue or brown eyes, blonde or brown hair, how intelligent it will be, etc.) from the mother and half from the father.

A sound is a wave, and sound waves can be formed from many sources, such as a dog barking, a tree falling, a thunder from a storm, or a person speaking. A sound wave travels through the air and you hear a sound when the sound wave reaches your ear and vibrates your eardrum. For instance, when a guitar is plucked, a sound wave is created and travels through the air. The fact that we perceive sounds of different pitch is because sound waves have different frequencies. When the string ""A"" of the guitar is plucked, it results in a low pitched sound. This is because the chord vibrates at low frequency. On the other hand, when the string ""B"" of the guitar is plucked, it results in a high pitched sound, because the chord vibrates at a higher frequency.

The organisms, such as knockout mice, are used to learn about a gene that has been sequenced, but whose function is unknown or incompletely known. Researchers draw inferences from the difference between the knockout organism and normal individuals. Knockout is often abbreviated as KO.
Gene knock-in is the opposite term. There a gene is switched on, or a working gene inserted.
Knockout is accomplished through a combination of techniques. It starts in the test tube with a plasmid, or other DNA construct, and proceeding to cell culture.
Individual cells are genetically transformed with the DNA construct. Often the goal is to create an animal that has the altered gene.
If so, embryonic stem cells are genetically transformed and inserted into early embryos.

The Chicago Manual Of Style lists four pages of additional rules for word division, e.g., not dividing personal names. The Chicago Manual Of Style allows dividing words with two letters (but never one letter) before the division. It doesn't allow leaving two letters after the division. This makes no sense to me. The reader should be able to recognize the word from the part before the division. The part after the division doesn't affect the reader's recognition of a word. I suggest instead trying to keep four or five letters before the division, and accepting two letters after a division.",very complex,"ss_annotator_1: Primarily simple and compound sentences, with some complex (or compound-complex) constructions.

Whether the war could have been avoided or not is without interest today. In fact, there is no controversy possible after Maximilian Harden's pronouncement. In it he throws away the scabbard and says boldly that Germany from the first was set on war. Hence it becomes a work of supererogation to find excuses for her, and hence, my old friend, Bernard Shaw, penned his long indictment of his hereditary enemy, England, all in vain.
We are a dull-witted race. Although the Continent has dubbed us ""Perfidious Albion,"" it is hard for us to take in general ideas, and no man clearly sees the possibilities of the development of the original sin that lies dormant in him.

Chenal closed the performance by singing the French national hymn. I was told there would be difficulty in securing a seat.
I was rather skeptical. I also considered that I had had sufficient thrills since the beginning of the war, both old fashioned and new. I believed also that I had already heard the ""Marseillaise"" sung under the best possible circumstances to produce thrills. One of the first nights after mobilization 10,000 Frenchmen filled the street beneath the windows of The New York Times office, where I was at work. They sang the ""Marseillaise"" for two hours, with a solemn hatred of their national enemy sounding in every note. The solemnity changed to a wild passion as the night wore on. Finally, cuirassiers of the guard rode through the street to disperse the mob. It was a terrific scene.",very complex,"ss_annotator_1: Strange typographical errors.

He sees more, and he learns more from the seeing, than he will in later years unless his perceptive powers are definitely trained and observation made a habit. His judgment and his will are weak. He reasons imperfectly. He chooses without appropriate motives. He needs the building up and development given by educational training. Nature points out the method.
Sensibility being the characteristic of his mind, we must appeal to him through his senses. We must use the concrete; through it we must act upon his weak will and immature judgment. From his natural curiosity we must develop attention. His naturally strong perceptive powers must be made yet stronger; they must be led in proper directions and fixed upon appropriate objects. He must be led to appreciate the relation between cause and effects--to associate together related facts--and to state what he knows in a definite, clear, and forcible manner.

868,5423,4,8.05,"The catbird belongs to the family of thrushes, and is one of the most peculiar of our American birds. It is dark colored, with brown head and neck, and greenish-black tail. The bird is fond of society, and usually builds its nest near the dwellings of men, rather than in the quiet of the forest.
Its voice, when angry or disturbed, is harsh and shrill, but at other times, soft and sweet. It has also a cry like the mewing of a cat, from which it derives its name. It is very courageous, and will defend its young until it falls exhausted.
The catbird can be tamed, but is as mischievous as a young monkey,—meddlesome, full of curiosity, and so jealous, that it will drive any other pet bird out of the house. It dislikes to be caged, preferring the freedom of the room, so that it may look in the looking-glass, take pins off from the cushion, or perch on the plants in the window.",moderately complex,"ss_annotator_1: While an expository text, it has a conversational tone.

Also, sentences 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 contain multiple concepts, meaning only two sentences (1 and 7) have single concepts. Third graders learn to use linking words and phrases in their writing, and identify words related to text structures, such as time order and sequences, in their reading. These skills will help them decipher the subordinate phrases/clauses and transition words in this text. However, with most of the sentences having 2-3 concepts, it will still be too difficult for most 3rd graders to tackle on their own. Since the sentences were not ""mainly"" complex, the text could not be rated Exceedingly Complex, but since there were so many subordinate phrases, transitions, and concepts, it could also not be rated Moderately Complex. The Flesch Kincaid level, based on average sentence and word lengths, rates this text as appropriate for grades 6-8.

The special feature of credit cards is that you do not have to pay back the entire bill right then. Imagine you spent $5,000 last month. When you get the bill, you might only have to use your $1,000 to pay the bill, but you still have all $5,000 worth of stuff you bought.
This functions as a loan because the credit card company has, in a round-about way, loaned you that leftover $4,000. As with a loan, you will still have to pay that $4,000 back eventually, and the credit card company will charge you interest on it.

Almost everything was made of wood, as spoons, tankards, pails, firkins, hinges for cupboard and closet doors, latches, plows, and harrows. Every boy learned to use his jack-knife, and could make brooms from birch trees, bowls and dippers and bottles from gourds, and butter paddles from red cherry. The women made soap and candles, carded wool, spun, wove, bleached or dyed the linen and woolen cloth, and made the garments for the family. They knit mittens and stockings, made straw hats and baskets, and plucked the feathers from live geese for beds and pillows.
On the farms the houses of the early settlers were of logs, or were framed structures covered with shingles or clapboards. The tables, chairs, stools, and bedsteads were of the plainest sort, and were often made of puncheons, that is, of small tree trunks split in half. Sometimes the table would be a long board laid across two X supports. This was ""the board,"" around which the family sat at meals. In the better houses in the towns the furniture was of course very much finer.",very complex,"ss_annotator_1: Fourth graders are better able to handle compound and complex sentences, as well as detailed lists and historical descriptions.

Good text for following directions.
ss_annotator_2: The passage contains long, multi-step instructions with precise measurements, fractions, and specialized terms (e.g., “darning needle,” “linen thread,” “wax and twist”). Many sentences are compound or complex and describe sequential steps that require careful attention. Grade 3 students might struggle with both the technical vocabulary and the multi-step reasoning needed to follow the directions independently.

Her father, Arthur Keller, spent many years as an editor for the Tuscumbia North Alabamian newspaper, and had served as a captain in the Army. Her mother, Kate Adams, was the daughter of a confederate general. Helen was born with the ability to see and hear. At 19 months old, she became ill, and this illness left Helen both deaf and blind.
As she grew up, she found a way of communicating with the daughter of the family's cook; Martha Washington. They invented a kind of sign language and by the time Helen was 7 years old they had created more than 60 different signs for use in their personal communication.
Around this time, Helen became very frustrated and diffcult to control. She had violent temper tantrums and would giggle uncontrollably when she was happy. Her family was worried about Helen and went in search of help. Unaware of how to deal with Helen's disabilities, the family had indulged , which at this point it was to her detriment.",very complex,"ss_annotator_1: Good fit!

The transitions are helpful to understand the timeline being explained. They get bored with simple text structure- so this is great!
ss_annotator_2: The text uses some advanced vocabulary (e.g., confederate general, indulged, detriment), as well as longer, complex sentences. The biography structure, however, is familiar and interesting for this age group, especially with the dramatic change in Helen Keller’s life at 19 months. Third graders could follow the story but may need support in understanding certain terms and historical references.

Her family lived on an estate called Ivy Greens, built by Helen's grandfather.”). students are developing their ability to comprehend compound and early complex sentences, but this passage includes several long descriptive statements and shifts in time that may challenge their fluency. Shorter, simpler sentences would better align with Grade 3 expectations. However, with teacher support (pausing to chunk sentences or rereading), students at this level could still follow the structure.

vocab_annotator_2: This passage is appropriate for third-graders, in that it is written in relatively simple sentence structure, and the vocabulary is not unreasonably difficult.
vocab_annotator_3: The style of this writing is straight forward and easy to read for this fourth grader. The topic is also familiar with fourth graders. Most of the vocabulary words are words that fourth graders have seen or used before in text. The complex words are proper nouns and a fourth grader may not know them, but should know that they identify specific places.","ability, captain, communicating, confederate, deteriment, detriment, disabilities, editor, estate, frustrated, general, illness, indulged, tantrums, temper tantrums, unaware, uncontrollably","blind, confederate, deaf, detriment, sign language, signs","deaf, temper","alabama, ivy greens, north alabamian, tuscumbia, tuscumbia north alabamian","Students are likely familiar with basic biographical information about Helen Keller and the concept of sign language, but may not be familiar with the historical context of the Confederate background or the specific challenges of being both deaf and blind."

This allows it to be appropriate for third. Without that sentence I would say the ext complexity would be too easy.
ss_annotator_2: Justification: The sentences in this passage are very long, technical, and heavily dependent on multiple clauses (e.g., “The hands are insulated from the case and communicate with one of the poles of a pile contained in the box.”). Third graders are still developing comfort with compound sentences and would find the scientific language (apparatus, insulated, circuit, corresponding, requirements) plus the sentence length overwhelming. The structure is not grade-appropriate for independent reading at Grade 3. It would require teacher scaffolding, breaking down sentences, and simplifying vocabulary.

When this fuel is burned in the presence of oxygen, the chemical potential energy is transferred into light and heat energy. In the same way, the glucose from the food that you eat is combined with oxygen in a series of chemical reactions to release the energy. The glucose is broken down and the energy is released. This energy is then used to drive all the other processes in your body. This process is called respiration.

These wires reach the brain via the spinal cord. At some point, both wires meet and pass through a place, which you can think of as a gate. This gate has a certain width that decides which signals can go through. If there is only the pain signal, without the rubbing, the gate will let all of the pain through.

978,8013,4,4.14,"What do you do when you hit your knee on a chair? You touch your knee and you rub it, don’t you? Some scientists believe that we rub the hurting body part to reduce the pain. They call this “gate control theory of pain”.
This theory is quite complicated. However, to get an idea of it, imagine again the wires called neurons. There are wires that send pain and others that send the rubbing sensation to the brain. These wires reach the brain via the spinal cord. At some point, both wires meet and pass through a place, which you can think of as a gate. This gate has a certain width that decides which signals can go through. If there is only the pain signal, without the rubbing, the gate will let all of the pain through. However, if you also rub your knee, the gate will let the rubbing signal pass but only part of the pain signal. That is why you reduce the pain if you rub your injured body part",moderately complex,"ss_annotator_1: Typos where apostrophe and quotation marks belong inhibit comprehension and serve as distraction. in the second paragraph, it says ""imagine again"".

Flamingos eat organisms such as plankton, shrimps, crabs and tiny water plants. All of these have special coloring agents which cause a flamingo to turn pink when it eats them.
If you take a flamingo away from its natural habitat and don't feed it these kinds of food, their color will turn whiter and whiter as days pass by. Flamingos are water birds – they live and feed near the sea coast and lakes as the food they eat is found in water. They are quite tall – some of them can grow up to a height of 1.5 meters. That is almost as tall as a human!
These birds have very long legs so they can walk far into the water. Although most photos will show you pictures of flamingos wading in the shallow water, these birds can also swim!

1016,3047,3,8.85,"Memory is a very large topic, and researchers divide the topic of memory to make it easier to study. There is long-term memory, short-term memory, and working memory. Long-term memory allows you to remember information for some time—for a few minutes, or for your whole life. For example, if you are divided into groups and are given a number, you will remember your group number for the entire activity. Or, you will remember your name for a lifetime. Short-term memory stores immediate information and is erased in less than a minute. For example, if someone tells you a phone number and you dial it immediately and then forget it. It is more difficult to dial a phone number if a person tells you the whole phone number at once, as opposed to telling you the number in bits and pieces. When you work with short-term memory, it is called working memory. For example, when you read a sentence, you need to remember the first words in the sentence until you finish reading the end of the sentence. Or else, the sentence will not make any sense!

In birds, males tend to be beautifully colored, while the females are not—just think of ducks, chicken, or peacocks. But do you know how to distinguish spider-men and -women? Usually, female spiders are bigger, but only if they are well-fed. Females can also be a different color than the males of their species, but this is not true for all species. You can use another really safe trick to identify a male spider. In front of their four walking legs, both spider males and females have another pair of appendages, the pedipalps.

1029,7352,3,6.89,"In general, there are two ways clouds form. In both cases, though, the clouds form because the air is cooling. In the atmosphere, rising air cools and sinking air warms. In most cases, the clouds that you see are caused by rising air.
Clouds can also form when the air gets colder for other reasons. This can happen overnight when the air is cooling, or when warm air moves over a cold lake or a snowcovered surface.
Clouds are classified based on how high they are in the sky, whether they are made up of tiny water droplets or ice crystals, their general appearance, and whether they are producing precipitation. On the next few pages, I'll explain some of the basic terminology used to classify clouds.
Puffy clouds are called cumulus or have the prefix ""cumulo."" Clouds that form a layer are called stratus or have the prefix ""strato.""

Grass is their usual food; it wears the teeth down, but horses' teeth continue to grow during life. Horses also have adapted to run fast, which helps them to escape their predators, such as lions. These features are the product of the process of adaptation.

These pyramids of Meroe possess one marked feature, distinguishing them from the pyramids of Egypt proper--that is, they have an external doorway or porch. As there is no entrance to the pyramid at these porticoes, it is quite possible that they were temples for worship or making offerings to the dead.

When hot air is blown in the blast furnace, the coke will burn and reduce the oxygen off the ore, producing bare iron and carbon dioxide. The limestone will bind off any remaining bedrock. The iron melts in the hot temperature and is tapped off in liquid phase at the bottom. It is then worked into steel. The limestone and bedrock form a compound called slag. It can be used for making bricks, concrete or road topping. Earlier methods include Bloomery.
Aluminum is smelted in electric ovens called electric arc furnaces. The aluminum ore is poured on the bottom of the furnace and electric current is led through the ore. The temperature rises so high that the oxygen separates, leaving metallic aluminum.

Both sides blame each other for starting the war. The north, led by communist Kim Il-Sung, was helped mostly by People's Republic of China, and the USSR. There was medical support from Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Poland. Other support came from Mongolia and India. The south, led by nationalist Syngman Rhee, was helped by many countries in the United Nations, and especially by the United States.
The war did not end but a ceasefire was put in place.

The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910.

In a column of fluid, pressure increases with depth as a result of the weight of the overlying fluid. Thus the pressure at the bottom of a column of fluid is greater than at the top of the column. Similarly, the pressure at the bottom of an object submerged in a fluid is greater than at the top of the object. This pressure difference results in a net upwards force on the object. The magnitude of that force exerted is proportional to that pressure difference, and (as explained by Archimedes' principle) is equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy the volume of the object, i.e. the displaced fluid.

These subspecies differed not only in where they grew, but also differed in some of their morphological features. The crossing between Criollo and Forastero trees gave rise to a third type, known as Trinitario.

Prices for major cash crops are set in commodity markets with global scope, with some local variation (termed as ""basis"") based on freight costs and local supply and demand balance.

1073,1992,3,12.45,"An automated external defibrillator (AED) is a self-contained defibrillator device designed to be movable, and easy and simple to use. They are often shaped like briefcases so that they can be carried by a handle. An AED contains a battery, a control computer, and electrodes. When the electrodes are stuck onto the patient, the control computer will assess the patient, checking the rhythm of their heart. It will then charge itself to an appropriate power level and tell users that the person needs to be shocked. If the patient does not need to be defibrillated, the automated external defibrillator will not allow a shock to be administered. A button must still be pushed manually to trigger the shock, as the operator beforehand must be certain that nobody is touching the patient. Often, automated external defibrillators will have speakers which give instructions when they are opened.

Executive functions are a set of abilities that help you do complex tasks, such as planning your schoolwork, completing assignments, and having control over your emotions and frustrations. One of the most important executive functions is called working memory. Working memory allows you to hold information in mind and perform mental operations, for example, adding large numbers in your mind. Another important executive function is inhibition, which helps you to resist distractions and temptations, for example, the temptation to eat the entire jar of cookies. A third executive function is cognitive flexibility, which helps you to quickly shift your attention back and forth between different tasks, like switching back and forth between your homework and your YouTube feed.

Particular proteins along the axon allow nerve cells to respond to the local environment. When these proteins are not successfully transported and are absent from the axon, the nerve cell is unable to function correctly, which can result in deterioration and nerve cell death.
Two additional cargoes transported toward the axon terminal are vesicles, which are like small sacks full of proteins or other substances, and mitochondria, which are the structures that provide a source of energy for the cell.

As the microorganisms are buried, the tremendous amount of seawater and sediments above squeeze their living environment. The deeper the microorganisms are buried, the less water is in their immediate environment. Thus, while the seafloor is right under seawater, the microorganisms under the seafloor can face a lack of water.
Another challenge to these deep microorganisms is a lack of food. Less than 10% of the organic food from the sea surface eventually reaches the seafloor.",not scored,not scored,exceedingly complex,"vocab_annotator_1: The text contains a substanil number of academic (e.g., pressures,) and domain specific words (e.g., microorganisms) words that are essential for determing meaning.

1087,2211,3,9.62,"Especially at school, it can be very helpful to actively use your schema knowledge when you learn new information. You can do this in different ways. Before starting a lesson, you can revisit what you have learned before about a certain topic (for example, that fish lay eggs). Or, while studying, you can pause often and think about what you just learned and how the new knowledge links to what you already know. This will help you to use your medial prefrontal cortex to integrate new information and remember it better for tests. In addition, such integration helps you to build better schemas so you can remember new, related information even better in the future.
Sometimes, we can use memory ""tricks"" to link new knowledge to our schema knowledge. For example, when learning a list of words, you can link these words to places in your room or another familiar environment. This is called the method of loci (loci means ""places"" in Latin).

Medication can help people with HIV to lead normal lives, but many young people find it difficult to tell others that they have HIV. Telling others about having HIV can help people get more support, reduce their chances of passing HIV to others, and help them take medication as prescribed.

This means that even gentle rip currents can take swimmers of all abilities a long way offshore. A rip current can easily move someone the length of a football field in just 1 min. What makes these currents dangerous is that you do not feel anything, you are just going with the flow. It is only when you realize that you are suddenly a long way from the safety of the beach that things get scary, and that is when most people start to panic.

You might draw a series of parallel lines showing the path of the sunlight from the window to the floor. This is not exactly accurate — no matter how hard you look, you will not find unique lines of light in the sunbeam! However, this is a good way to draw light and to model light geometrically.
We call these narrow, imaginary lines of light light rays. Recall that light can behave like a wave and so you can think of a light ray as the path of a point on the crest of a wave.
We can use light rays to model the behaviour of light relative to mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, and prisms. The study of how light interacts with materials is called optics.
