## Overview

This repository showcases my coursework for **INST447: Data Sources and Manipulation** at the **University of Maryland**. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate applied data science skills developed throughout the semester, including acquiring, cleaning, transforming, and analyzing real‑world datasets using Python.

INST447 emphasizes hands‑on learning and practical data workflows commonly used in industry and research settings.

---

## Course Objectives

Throughout this course, students learn how to:

* Identify and evaluate data sources
* Work with structured and semi‑structured data
* Clean and preprocess messy real‑world datasets
* Manipulate data using pandas
* Work with multiple file formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet)
* Build reproducible data analysis pipelines

## Labs

The lab notebooks focus on skill‑building and experimentation.

Examples include:

* Introduction to pandas
* Dataframe indexing and filtering
* Handling missing values
* String manipulation and regular expressions
* Working with JSON and nested data

Labs build foundational skills that support larger assignments and the final project.

---

## Assignments

Assignments apply lecture concepts to realistic data scenarios. Topics include:

* Data ingestion and exploration
* Data cleaning and transformation
* Combining multiple datasets
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Each assignment emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, and proper documentation.

---

## Final Project

The final project integrates multiple course concepts into one complete workflow.

### Components:

* **FINALProj.ipynb** – Data collection, cleaning, transformation, and analysis
* **FinalProjReport.pdf** – Written report describing methodology, findings, and conclusions

The project demonstrates end‑to‑end data handling using real datasets.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python 3**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **JSON / CSV / Parquet file formats**

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/my1e2/INST447.git
```

2. Open Jupyter Lab or Notebook:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

3. Open any `.ipynb` file to explore the analysis.
